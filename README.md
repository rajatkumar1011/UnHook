This project enables user to watch YouTube videos with peace, without the expense of losing their sanity over random cringe recommendations or autoplay videos that often lead to binge watching unnecessary videos and later regretting over it. Instead simply paste the url of youtube video and watch here.
I know it's a bit clumsy work to do. 
I'm working on enabling search feature into it, so you can directly access the video through this.
